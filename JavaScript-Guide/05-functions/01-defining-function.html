    <h3>What is function ?</h3>
    <p>Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function is a JavaScript procedureâ€”a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.</p>
    <h3>Defining functions</h3>
    <p>A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:</p>
    <ul>
        <li> The name of the function.</li>
        <li> A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.</li>
        <li> The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, { }.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by value; the value is passed to the function, but if the function changes the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected globally or in the calling function.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you pass an object (i.e. a non-primitive value, such as Array or a user-defined object) as a parameter and the function changes the object's properties, that change is visible outside the function, as shown in the following example:</p>
    <p>
        function myFunc(theObject) {
        <br> theObject.make = "Toyota";
        <br> }
        <br> var mycar = {make: "Honda", model: "Accord", year: 1998};
        <br> var x, y;
        <br> x = mycar.make; // x gets the value "Honda"
        <br> myFunc(mycar);
        <br> y = mycar.make; // y gets the value "Toyota"
        <br> // (the make property was changed by the function)
        <br>
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Function expressions</h3>
    <p>While the function declaration above is syntactically a statement, functions can also be created by a function expression. Such a function can be anonymous; it does not have to have a name.</p>
