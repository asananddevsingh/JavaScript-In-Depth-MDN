        /******** SECTION 6 *********/
        /*        Variable scope

        When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a local variable, because it is available only within that function.

        JavaScript before ECMAScript 6 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case is an if statement.*/
        console.log('/******** SECTION 6 *********/');

        (function () {
            if (true) {
                var x = 5;
            }
            console.log('X defined in true block will take the scope of funtion and its value is = ', x); // 5

            //This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript 6.
            if (true) {
                let y = 5;
            }
            //console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not defined
        })();

        /* * * * * * * * SECTION 7 * * * * * * * * * /
        /*       Variable hoisting

        Another unusual thing about variables in JavaScript is that you can refer to a variable declared later, without getting an exception. This concept is known as hoisting; variables in JavaScript are in a sense "hoisted" or lifted to the top of the function or statement. However, variables that are hoisted will return a value of undefined. So even if you declare and initialize after you use or refer to this variable, it will still return undefined.*/
        console.log('/******** SECTION 7 *********/');
        (function () {
            console.log(x === undefined); // true
            var x = 3;
        })();
